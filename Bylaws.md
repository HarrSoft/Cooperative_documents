## Types of membership and equity structure  {#types-of-membership-and-equity-structure}

Harrsoft will work with contractors, freelancers, and independent organizations at their market rate. However people who wish to become members of Harrsoft must be in a longer term partnership in one or more of the startups Harrsoft will start or partner with, or in a long term partnership with Harrsoft as a working professional.

A Member is a part owner of Harrsoft who agrees to the membership agreement. Anyone can be voted in as a member of Harrsoft at the discretion of all other members of harrsoft and/or the active board member group. Individuals can be desired as members for a variety of reasons, they may be professionals actively working on helping us build our service offerings or internal startups, community representatives, or people who have been appointed to an administrative role at Harrsoft managing one or more components of our operations.

Members automatically become board members while the number of individuals are below 30, and will have voting rights regarding Harrsoft operations no matter the number of members in harrsoft. Past 30 members it will be beneficial to have an elected board that takes responsibility for administrative tasks the size of which will be determined by the members when the need arises. Board members will determine the projects we take on, and will have the right and responsibility to participate in any Internal committee or decision making process. Non-board members may join and participate in Board member meetings with equal voting rights at any time, but board members will be held responsible for structuring the meeting proceedings, taking notes, communicating changes and implementing policies.

Members who are not board members will have the right to elect board members on a yearly basis, and submit proposals for changes that the board members will be obligated to consider vote on in a timely manner. Board members may choose to relinquish their role so long as the number of members are below 30, and any member(s) may levy a proposal to revoke a board member’s position at any time.

Members must agree to abide by the rules of the membership agreement, and the charter in order to remain as members of Harrsoft. Any member deemed to not be acting in good faith in accordance with the principles and goals of Harrsoft may be subject to expulsion from their membership after a 30 day notice, and a membership wide vote.


## Governance structure, and decision making procedures. {#governance-structure-and-decision-making-procedures}

A regular meeting time will be set each week that will have a list of action items that need to be addressed. Each meeting will have an outline be presented ahead of time and (a) board member(s) will be elected to act as an officer and arbitrator for each meeting in the outline. Meeting notes will be taken by at least one person who attended and after being finalized in a timely manner shared with the members of the group. The meeting will be recorded for archival reference, and submitted to an internal log along with the notes. Members are free to attend or skip without formal penalty or any other informal demerit.

Action items will consist of approving proposals, addressing requests, and discussing performance of Harrsoft services and ways to improve and expand them. Action items can also act as any general task that needs to be addressed by all members of the community.

Emergency meetings can be called to address time sensitive issues, where members who volunteer to address the issue will take responsibility for dealing with the problem. In the next upcoming regular meeting, members may call for a vote on whether emergency resolutions were handled responsibly, and/or to roll back previous decisions.

Members cannot at any time vote to:



* Prevent equitable distribution of revenue among all members of the cooperative
* Change any rules regarding voting or governance procedures without the unanimous consent of all members who choose to participate in the vote.

### Voting {#voting}


Members who were given the outline of a meeting at least one week in advance to enable them to submit a vote ahead of time for action items, if a vote is not submitted at the time of review during the meeting, will be assumed to have withheld voting rights for that action item. Members can retroactively vote for action items or withdraw support for an action item after a decision has been made to rollback changes at any time via a proposal.

The voting process can be implemented in one of two ways: consent or, in cases with more than two options, single transferable vote (STV). A decision reaches consent when all voting members are first informed about the prospective action, and given the chance to state their dissent. Dissent can be given on the following grounds:



1. Belief that the decision will contradict Harrsoft values
2. The decision will have harmful impact on a person, animal, or the environment
3. The decision will impede a member’s ability to fulfill their roles at HarrSoft

Matters that must be determined with a membership-wide vote include, but are not limited to:



4. Wages and Benefits on a per role basis
5. Distribution of revenue
6. What they will make through what we provide through our goods and services
7. Standards or ethics of the HarrSoft cooperative
8. Changes to the charter
9. Admitting new members
10. Hiring contractors 
11. Partner with other organizations
12. Expulsions of any member
13. Support for non-profit organizations using Harrsoft resources and labor 
14. Whether a HarrSoft offering (good or service) of a certain category, quality, or characteristic fit within the HarrSoft identity and values
15. Operational decisions that could affect other members or the institution at large.

Matters that may be determined without a vote, and are autonomously enacted by members are:



1. Which specific goods and services (within membership-defined boundaries) each member creates and/or provides.
2. Members may freely leave Harrsoft at any time. However doing so means that they must relinquish their ownership shares back to Harrsoft. 


## Asset and Profit Distribution {#asset-and-profit-distribution}

Members are able to hold sole ownership of certain components of the organization, providing they are still contributing to the revenue pool with that component but must have primary legal responsibility for some reason or another. These cases must be approved by unanimous decision of the members of board, and should be avoided and dissolved when possible.

This will serve as an escape hatch for when members need to purchase tools, services, or take out loans or something similar to accomplish their respective goals within the community.

Otherwise revenue is distributed as determined by proposals that outline what will be retained to pay for upkeep costs, and what will be used to pay member owners of the cooperative. Of revenue not chosen to be used for upkeep or growth of the cooperative the remaining revenue will be equally distributed among all members of the cooperative as pay for their participation in the cooperative. This goes beyond any wages or benefits that the cooperative elects to award said member for any services or responsibilities they render to the cooperative.

Access to assets will be granted to every member when feasible, and when assets are limited members will be able to submit requests to the community for support to get more if the need arises and funding is available to achieve it.
